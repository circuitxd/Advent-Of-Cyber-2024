Welcome to Advent of Cyber 2024!
In this year’s Advent of Cyber, can you help McSkidy and the Glitch defend SOC-mas against the evil Mayor Malware’s plans?

Dive into the wonderful world of cyber security by engaging in festive beginner-friendly exercises every day in the lead-up to Christmas!

Advent of Cyber is available to all TryHackMe users, and best of all, it's free to participate in. You’ll also be in with the chance of winning from this year’s huge $100,000 prize draw. The more questions you complete, the higher your chances of winning BIG!

Think of it like an advent calendar, but with exciting (and festive) security challenges instead of chocolate.
